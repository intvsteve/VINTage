</head>

    <h1 style="margin-left: 5px;">Setup for <b><i>jzIntv</i></b></h1>
    <div style="height: 8px; background: Green; border: 0px none; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: normal normal normal 0px/0px sans-serif;"></div>

    <h2>1. Locate the Emulator</h2>
    <p>A recent - possibly experimental! - version of jzIntv is already included with this version of the <b><i>LTO&nbsp;Flash!</i>&nbsp;User&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;Software</b>
    (LUI)! If you would like to use a different
    version of jzIntv, such as one downloaded from <a href="http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/" target="_blank">here</a>,
    you can change the location of the emulator in the <b>Paths</b> area of the jzIntv settings.</p>

    <p>You can locate the jzIntv settings on the <b>jzIntv</b> page in the application <b>Settings</b> dialog.
    The settings are also accessible from the <b>jzIntv</b> tab in the Windows program, or from the
    <b>Tools&raquo;jzIntv</b> menu in the Mac application.</p>

    <h2>2. Additional Required Files</h2>
    <p>For jzIntv to successfully emulate Intellivision<sup>&reg;</sup> ROMs, you will need to have the following files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>REQUIRED: </b>EXEC.BIN</li>
      <li><b>REQUIRED: </b>GROM.BIN</li>
      <li><b>OPTIONAL: </b>ECS.BIN (possibly also ECS.CFG and ECSPATCH.BIN)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These files have been available from <a href="https://www.blueskyrangers.com" target="_blank">Blue&nbsp;Sky&nbsp;Rangers,&nbsp;Inc.</a>
    (previously Intellivision&nbsp;Productions,&nbsp;Inc.) in various products over the years. The best way to get these ROMs, as well as a
    nice collection of games, is to first check to see if Blue Sky Rangers, Inc. or Intellivision Entertainment, LLC has a product available
    that contains these files. Recently, this has not been the case, meaning the most effective way to properly get a copy of these files is
    to locate a copy of <b><i>Intellivision&nbsp;Lives!</i></b>, <b><i>Intellivision&nbsp;Rocks</i></b>, or
    <b><i>Intellivision&nbsp;Greatest&nbsp;Hits</i></b> for Windows or Mac.</p>

    <p>You can configure the location of these files from the jzIntv <b>Path</b> settings. If your copy of jzIntv already has
    a copy of these ROMs in the same directory as the jzintv program itself, you do not need to configure these paths.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE: </b>The included copy of jzIntv is located in the LUI application folder. It is better to configure the jzIntv
    settings to refer to these files in their current locations, rather than to copy them into the installed copy of <b>LUI</b>. Doing so ensures that
    the support files will not be removed from your system if you choose to remove the <b><i>LTO&nbsp;Flash!</i>&nbsp;User&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;Software</b>
    from your computer.</p>

    <h3>Mac-Specific Requirements</h3>
    <p>On Mac OS X, the jzIntv emulator requires the SDL framework, version 1.2. A copy of the disk image for this
    library is included in the application. If LUI detects a specific error that indicates that SDL is not on your
    Mac, you will be prompted to allow LUI to place a copy on your system. Note that this will only address the
    problem for the currently logged in user.</p>

    <h2>3. Playing a ROM</h2>
    <p>Once you've got jzIntv ready to go, there are a few ways you can instruct it to run. Simply right click on
    a ROM in LUI and choose <b>Play&nbsp;in&nbsp;jzIntv</b>. You can also browse to locate a ROM on disk if you have
    not added it to your list. There are other ways in the UI to do this, too. Can you find them all?</p>

    <p>As you explore the jzIntv settings, you will find that all the power and flexibility of jzIntv is available. In most
    cases, LUI tries to just &quot;Do the right thing&quot; to run jzIntv with the necessary settings.</p>
