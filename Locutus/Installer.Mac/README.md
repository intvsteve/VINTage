# Creating Fancy DMG Images

## About

This is a `Makefile` to help create fancy DMG images.
More information about usage etc. can be found
in the [Building Fancy DMG Images](https://el-tramo.be/guides/fancy-dmg/)
guide.

## Additional Notes

This has been modified from the original, and rather than using Makefile,
now uses installer.mak which is customized to build a DMG for LTO Flash!.
