KNOWN ISSUES
=============================================================================

A small number of known issues have not yet been resolved. Hopefully you will
not encounter these problems, or, if you do, it is infrequent and not too
burdensome.

ALL PLATFORMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Multiple Error Dialogs
-------------------------
During beta testing, a combination of a firmware bug (long since fixed) and
a very jittery and flakey console produced a condition in which a dialog that
reported the firmware error would appear multiple times. In addition to the
confluence of the firmware bug and the glitchy hardware, it also required these
console and computer to all be in the powered-on state, with LUI running. Over
the course of several days, multiple instances of the dialog appeared.

It may be possible that a future software update will address this issue,
for the time being, it remains in the product.

MAC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. System.InvalidCastException
------------------------------
In rare instances, when starting, the application reports an error of the
following form:

  System.InvalidCastException: Cannot cast from source type to destination type.

In all known cases thus far, this problem does not recur the next time you
start the application. It may be months before the problem recurs.

Unfortunately, it has not been possible to find a way to reproduce this
issue in order to debug it. It is suspected it may be a bug in the Mono
runtime, or a subtle side effect of some lifetime management issues present
in the MonoMac layer which may be solved by the Xamarin.Mac product.

If you do encounter this problem, simply start the application again. If
the problem continues, please contact support@intvfunhouse.com. Perhaps we
will be able to track down the cause of this issue together.

WINDOWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Strange visual artifacts in Windows Vista
--------------------------------------------
In some cases, when displaying the dialog to choose a backup ROM List,
Menu Layout, or device backup for restoration, the selection dialog displays
incorrectly in Windows Vista.

This was only observed during beta testing, when running LUI in a VMWare
virtual machine that ran Windows Vista 32-bit. Furthermore, the visual glitch
only presented itself while the application window was running in the
maximized state. Exiting the offending dialog (via the ESC key), restoring
the window to a non-maximized state, and choosing the menu option again did
not exhibit the behavior.

The latest versions (1.0.0b11 and later) have not shown this problem.
