# VINTage
Various Intellivision-related projects, including the ***LTO Flash!* User Interface** application.

This repository contains various projects that fall under the **VINTage** rubrik. As you will find in other readme files, the original inspiration dates back quite a few years to a project that intended to create an Intellivision emulator using the *G* programming langauge, also known as LabVIEW, from National Instruments.

Though that effort was never fully realized -- it stalled out due to feature creep and deficiencies in the sound libraries of the era -- the idea lived on. More than a decade later, the general *idea* of VINTage gained some new legs, initially as a private effort to create a modern-looking front end for the jzIntv Intellivision emulator using *C#*.

But, the reason you are here today is more likely due to the product ***LTO Flash!*** from **Left Turn Only, LLC**. When approached to create a multi-platform user interface for the coolest product for one of the all-time greatest vintage video game consoles ever (and my personal favorite), how could you say "no?"
